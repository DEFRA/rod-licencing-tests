# Contributing

## We develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).

1. Clone the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Open Government Licence

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same
[OGLv3 License](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/DEFRA/rod-licensing/issues)
